## Summary
Following all relevant academic literature in a fast-moving field is challenging, considering the high numbers of new articles published continuously. A metric to filter potentially interesting papers is the Altmetric score [1]. Scientists are increasingly using preprint servers such as bioRxiv [2] to publish new findings prior to going through a lengthy peer review procedure with more than 1000 submissions every month [3]. This tool is a Twitter bot written in Python which tweets bioRxiv preprints which reach the top 10% Altmetric attention score among articles from bioRxiv. The code can easily be adapted to follow other RSS feeds relevant to one's field as described in the documentation.
